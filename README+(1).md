## General Information
- BoomBikes company wants to understand the demand for sharing bike using independent variables provided in the dataset
- BoomBikes company wants overcome all the challenges using 2018 and 2019 data,and to coverup the losses which they have faced during pandemic
- The company wants to know:
    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
- day.csv dataset is used to predict the model

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- While analysing the data we have observed that the model is able to predict bike demand with an R2 value of 78.8%
- Model is able to predict data on the basic of yr,workingday,temp,windspeed,summer,winter,Sep,Sat,Light_Rain,Misty
